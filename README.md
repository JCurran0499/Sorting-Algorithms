# Sorting-Algorithms
A collection of standard sorting algorithms expressed in Java

Project Description: This collection of sorting algorithms includes Java representations of bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. More algorithms will be added to this as time goes on.

This is an independent, personal project, and is not affiliated with the University of Maryland or any other organization or individual. The project concept and implementation is mine, and all code is written by me, using knowledge obtained by the University of Maryland and independent studies.
